1.What is the length of the array:
int arr [][] = new int[3][4];
System.out.println(arr.length);
Ans : it is 3
//it means that length of the array is nothing but no of rows

2. is below code is valid or not
int arr[][] = new int[][6];

Ans: it is invalid because it is mandatory to mention number of rows  hence it is invalid
no of colomns is optional

3. is the below code is valid or not
int arr[][] = new int[5][];

Ans: it is valid because only no of rows is mandatory but no of columns are optional

4. Why in 2D arrays no of rows is mandatory but no of colomns are optional
Ans:
here we need to understand one thing
arr will store in stack memory
where as object will be created in heap, in heap how many number of object (arrays) created is mandatory but 

int arr [][] = new int[3][];

in heap [-,-,-] we can imagine this as array of arrays
each individual array will be created some other part of the heap

example:
int arr[][] = { {1,2,3},
		{4,5,6},
		{7,8,9}};

arr[1] will give {4,5,6}
arr[1][0] = 4
arr[1][1] = 5

arr[2] will give {7,8,9}
arr[2][0] = 7
arr[2][1] = 8
